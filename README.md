Unlock Mirotik Wireless Frequency Mode 

Some Mikrotik distributors in each country usually follow certain requirements to set standard rules such as "wireless frequency mode", "country", "antenna gain", "dfs mode", and this standard seems to also apply in several countries.

and usually to open the Lock frequency this can be done by netinstall, but this method is quite troublesome. well, so that it's easy, I'll just share the file, so I'll just have to use it directly later.
As usual, all you have to do is drag and drop the "routeros-open-lock.npk" file, then just restart the Mikrotik Router ðŸ™‚

don't worry, the file is safe from malware and viruses, because the file was created by myself, not dirty from any site.
Note: if there is a problem with Mikrotik, my friends, I am not responsible!
